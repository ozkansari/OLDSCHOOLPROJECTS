1-) By default, Tomcat uses ISO-8859-1 character encoding when decoding URLs 
received from a browser. This can cause problems when Confluence's encoding 
is UTF-8, and you are using international characters in attachment or page 
names. Edit conf/server.xml and find the line where the Coyote HTTP Connector 
is defined. 

<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
               connectionTimeout="20000" 
               redirectPort="8443" 
               URIEncoding="UTF-8" />
               
<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>
